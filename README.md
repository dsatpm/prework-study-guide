# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide is the introduction covering the basic topics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The main purpose is to practice the fundamentals of how a webpage is built. I built this project to further hone my skills in becoming a professional web developer, and because coding is extremely FUN! I learned how to use the basic functionality of arrays, "for" loops, and functions with JavaScript; I practiced how to make a webpage visually appealing using CSS; I learned the framework of HTML and what each tags' function and purpose is.
